package table

var tooltip = map[string]string{
	"filter": `This is  the  default table (if no -t option is passed). It contains the built-in chains INPUT (for packets destined to local sockets),
FORWARD (for packets being routed through the box), and OUTPUT (for locally-generated packets).`,

	"nat": `This table is consulted when a packet that creates a new connection is encountered.  It consists  of  four  built-ins:  PREROUTING  (for
altering  packets as soon as they come in), INPUT (for altering packets destined for local sockets), OUTPUT (for altering locally-gener‐
ated packets before routing), and POSTROUTING (for altering packets as they are about to go out).  IPv6 NAT support is  available  since
kernel 3.7.`,

	"mangle": `This table is used for specialized packet alteration.  Until kernel 2.4.17 it had two built-in chains: PREROUTING (for altering incoming
packets before routing) and OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before routing).  Since kernel 2.4.18, three  other  built-in
chains  are also supported: INPUT (for packets coming into the box itself), FORWARD (for altering packets being routed through the box),
and POSTROUTING (for altering packets as they are about to go out).`,

	"raw": `
This table is used mainly for configuring exemptions from connection tracking in combination with the NOTRACK target.  It  registers  at
the  netfilter  hooks  with  higher  priority and is thus called before ip_conntrack, or any other IP tables.  It provides the following
built-in chains: PREROUTING (for packets arriving via any network interface) OUTPUT (for packets generated by local processes)`,

	"security": `This table is used for Mandatory Access Control (MAC) networking rules, such as those enabled by the SECMARK  and  CONNSECMARK  targets.
Mandatory Access Control is implemented by Linux Security Modules such as SELinux.  The security table is called after the filter table,
allowing any Discretionary Access Control (DAC) rules in the filter table to take effect before MAC rules.  This table provides the fol‐
lowing  built-in chains: INPUT (for packets coming into the box itself), OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before routing),
and FORWARD (for altering packets being routed through the box).`,
